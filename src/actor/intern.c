 * src/actor/intern.c — pointer-slot intern table.
 *
 * Entity's pointer fields (atlas at +0x28, bytecode at +0x2C, pixels at
 * +0x14, etc.) are 4-byte slot IDs to preserve the original 32-bit
 * binary layout. On a 64-bit host, real pointers are 8 bytes — so each
 * unique pointer is interned into a small table; the returned slot ID
 * fits in 32 bits, and resolve round-trips back to the real pointer.
 *
 * Why this matters: bug "ptr-truncate" — writing a 64-bit pointer as
 * *(uint32_t *)(eb + 0x28) = (uint32_t)(uintptr_t)atlas
 * silently truncates the upper 32 bits, then a later deref crashes on
 * a bogus 32-bit address. The slot table is the fix; bypassing it on
 * any pointer-in-u32 field re-introduces the bug.
 *
 * Slot 0 is reserved for NULL so a memset-zeroed Entity reads its
 * pointer fields back as NULL via resolve(0).
