/* src/actor/walker.c — actor motion + waypoint path-finding.
 *
 * Drives the two controllable actors (Ebek, Fjej):
 *
 *   - Per-frame work (UpdateActorMovement): refresh perspective scale
 *     so actors shrink as they walk into scene depth.
 *
 *   - On-click binding (BindActorWalker / BindActorWalkerDirect):
 *     given a target click position, choose a directional walk anim
 *     (L/R/U/D) and patch op 0x15 in the walker bytecode so the per-
 *     entity VM steps the actor toward the target on its next tick.
 *     If a straight-line path is blocked by scene geometry, fall back
 *     to a waypoint chain via the scene's perspective bands.
 *
 *   - Per-frame waypoint advance (PerActorWaypointAdvanceTick): when
 *     a waypoint-routed walker reaches the current leg's target,
 *     bind the next leg. Continues until the walker is on the final
 *     (originally-requested) target leg.
 *
 * The waypoint graph (ActorWaypoints) is built once per scene from
 * the FILD body's perspective bands. Nodes are bands, edges connect
 * band pairs whose straight line is fully walkable. Per-click work
 * adds source/target pseudo-nodes (band IDs 0xFE / 0xFF), then runs
 * a BFS from the target frontier and picks the source-connected
 * band with minimum total cost.
