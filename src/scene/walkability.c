/* src/scene/walkability.c — per-pixel walkability lookup.
 *
 * is_walkable_at consults the current scene's FLD bitmap to determine
 * whether a given screen-space pixel sits on a walkable surface. Used
 * by the walker bind path's straight-line clip and by the waypoint
 * pathfinder.
 *
 * Returns 1 inside the walkable area, 0 outside (including off-screen).
 * If no FLD has been loaded for the current scene (g_walk_fld_pixels
 * is NULL), the function falls back to a generous bounding box so
 * cutscenes and special rooms without an FLD still let walkers move.
