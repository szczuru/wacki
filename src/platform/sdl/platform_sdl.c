 * src/platform/sdl/platform_sdl.c — portable platform layer (SDL2):
 * the Platform* entry points + the cross-platform input/event pump.
 *
 * Replaces the original DirectDraw / WndProc / WaitMessage stack. The
 * engine renders into a flat 8-bpp uint8_t shadow buffer; this layer
 * uploads that buffer to a streaming SDL_Texture via a palette LUT
 * and pumps SDL events into the engine's input + key-latch globals.
 *
 * Headless mode (--headless) keeps SDL_Init alive (dummy video +
 * audio drivers) so the event queue + mixer callback still run, but
 * skips window/renderer/texture creation so CI smoke tests work
 * without a display.
 *
 * Public API (declared in wacki.h):
 *   PlatformInit / PlatformShutdown
 *   PlatformPresent  — upload + present one frame
 *   PlatformPumpEvents — drain SDL events, update input globals
 *   PlatformShouldQuit — set by SDL_QUIT / WINDOWCLOSE / ESC
 *   PlatformSetTextInput / PlatformPollTypedChar / PushTypedChar
 *   PlatformShowMessageBox
 *
 * g_touch_mode ("absolute" | "relative" | "off") — added for touch-capable
 * SDL targets beyond Android's dedicated overlay (Nintendo Switch today;
 * intended to carry over to future touch-capable ports like PS Vita / Wii
 * U). "absolute" is SDL's existing built-in tap-to-click behaviour
 * (unchanged from before this option existed); "relative" turns the whole
 * panel into a laptop-style touchpad (drag-to-move, never clicks — see
 * handle_finger_relative below); "off" ignores touch entirely. Persisted
 * via wacki.cfg like every other display/input knob. */
